---------------------------
This repository consists of the three tasks completed by me during this virtual experience program.

---------------------------

## Overview 
Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. You are an analyst within the Quantium analytics team and are responsible for delivering highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions. 

----------------------------
## Task -1 : Data Preparation and Customers Analytics

Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

We need to present a strategic recommendation to Julia that is supported by data which she can then use for the upcoming category review however to do so we need to analyse the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours. The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour. Consider what metrics would help describe the customersâ€™ purchasing behaviour.  

Main focus area:

**1. Data Cleaning:**

  - Explore both the transaction and purchase behaviour data file.
  - Create and interpret high level summaries of the data.
  - Find outliers/anomalies and missing data and deal with it.
  - Check data formats and correct if needed.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Derive extra features such as pack size and brand name from the data and define metrics of interest to enable you to draw insights on who spends on chips and what drives spends for each customer segment.

   

-----------------------------
## Task -2 : Experimentation and uplift testing

Extend your analysis from Task 1 to help you identify benchmark stores that allow you to test the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales.

Julia has asked us to evaluate the performance of a store trial which was performed in stores 77, 86 and 88.

Main focus area:

- Break down the monthly sales experience for each store by:
    - total sales revenue
    - total number of customers
    - average number of transactions per customer
- Find the best control stores for the above three trial stores using different metrics such as Pearson's correlation or magnitude distance.
- Once you have selected your control stores, compare each trial and control pair during the trial period. You want to test if total sales are significantly different in the trial period and if so, check if the driver of change is more purchasing customers or more purchases per customers etc.

## Task -3 : Analytics and Commercial Application

Use your analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for your client, the Category Manager.
